# Test Comment

This is a test to verify the auto-approve workflow with the new ORG_GITHUB_TOKEN.

Expected behavior:
1. Claude Auto Review should run automatically
2. PR should get auto-approved if checks pass
3. "Require Claude Review for Main" should pass (now checks for actual review text)
4. Auto-merge should be enabled
